				This is all a lot of information! Starting out can look daunting, but here's why I think is the best way to approach learning Swift!
				<br />
				<br />
				Of course, you'll want to start at the very beginning, and looking at the creator's own source material. Apple Inc.'s dedicated Swift documentation, it extensively covers all of Swift's workings.
				<br />
				Thankfully, accessing these files are free for everyone, and all you'll need is an internet connection to see them!
				<br />
				<br />
				You'll also need to download Xcode from the Mac App Store, with is free also. This is Apple Inc.'s own application that let's you use Swift on devices like Mac, or even iPad!
				<br />
				<br />
				Apple Inc. really spoil us for choice.
				<br />
				Or course, you can find bucket loads Swift material available from the iBooks Store on iOS to read at your leisure. You'll find the right book for you, whether you want light and easy to read material, or something packed with as much information as possible, you'll find it! 
				<br />
				<br />
				And if reading isn't really for you, try using Apple Podcasts, and find one of the many programming podcasts that feature Swift.
				<br />
				I'm yet to try, but I've been recommended iDeveloper by many sources. They focus on Swift's iOS and macOS development, discussing tools and techniques, and offering tips and advice.
				<br />
				<br />
				If you'd like a more structured approach to learning Swift, try an online course. The most popular and highly acclaimed Swift 3 course on web currently is from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>, and is called 'iOS 10 & Swift 3: From Beginner to Paid Professional course by Mark Price.'
				With 4.5 stars with more than 41,000 students, including 264 lectures that total over 70 hours, those numbers can't lie!
				<br />
				<br />
				And finally, in the end of all of this, the best way to learn and improve is by doing. Complete your own projects using Swift! After all, practice makes perfect!
