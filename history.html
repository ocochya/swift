                <h1>Swift</h1>	
			<p>
				Swift is a relatively new language. It first was released by Apple Inc. on the 2nd of June, 2014. 
				<br />
				<br />
				Compared to other languages, this one is just a baby! Most prominent programming languages, like Python, and Java, were released in the 1990's!
				<br />
				<br />
				Despite being one of the younger languages, with Swift's release in the 21st century, it's extremely powerful and modernized. 
				<br />
				<br />
				This makes it ideal for new programmers to pick up, since it is streamlined and efficient in its workings, which allow it to rival most other languages in terms of usability. 
				<br />
				<br />
				You can read about these other languages by clicking on the 'Languages Home' link on the navigation bar! 
			</p>
			<p>
				This language was influenced by, of course, the most iconic and well used language in the modern age. Basing this language off of others like Ruby, Python, C#, and more, allow experienced programmers pick up the basics and find some common footing between this language and others.
				<br />
				<br />
				This language also introduces new, modern ways of programming, and finds its place nicely among the other languages, standing out by providing new ways to approach creating apps, and other software.
				<br />
				<br />
				Swift is clearly a popular language, with Swift making the top 10 in the monthly TIOBE index ranking of popular programming languages in March of 2017, and was ranked 11th at the end of 2017! 
				<br />
				<br />
				This is obvious big for Swift as a language, since the TIOBE index ranking of popular programming languages is always in the eye of the programming community, and being carefully watched each month!
			</p>
			<p>
				It's not certain what the future holds for Swift, but we can be sure it's bright! 
				<br />
				<br />
				With simple things like now being able to learn Swift on the Apple iPad, increasing accessibility, and other progressive moves by Swift, we can be positive that this could very much become as popular and well-loved as Java or Python.
				<br />
				<br />
				We can only be excited for Swift's future as a language!
