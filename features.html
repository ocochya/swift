			<p>
				With Swift 4 being released this year, a plethora of new features have been added to Swift's already long list of features.
				<br />
				<br />
				Swift boasts usability, speed, accessibility, modernization, and renovation as it's key aspects and main features.
				<br />
				<br />
				Swift's claim that "It builds on the best parts of C and objective C, without being constrained by its compatibility" is easily accepted by programmers after they began to use this language.
				<br />
				<br />
				Swift is constantly updating and improve, with Apple Inc. working hard to push new updates and features to the public to utilize.
				<br />
				<br />
				New features like playgrounds, in the app Xcode for the iPad, make writing Swift code easy and fun. Type a line of code and the result appears immediately in the app! This makes Swift accessible on more platforms, and more entertaining to use also!
				<br />
				<br />
				Swift eliminates entire classes of unsafe or volatile code. Variables are always initialized before use, arrays and integers are checked for overflow, and memory is managed automatically. This makes Swift stand above the rest, and provides another layer of safety when coding! It makes Swift less frustrating to use, unlike some other languages I know!
				<br />
				<br />
				You can create an entirely new application with Swift right now on multiple platforms, or begin using Swift code to implement features or increase functionality to code in xcode. Swift code exists together, with side your existing Objective-C files in the same project, with full access to your Objective-C API, making it easy to adopt for everyone!
				<br />
				<br />
				From its release and development, Swift was built to be fast. Swift code is optimized so that that gets the most out of modern hardware. The syntax and library have also been perfected to make the easiest, and simplest way to write your code also perform the best.
				<br />
				<br />
				Swift combines strong type inference and pattern matching easy to understand syntax, allowing complex and complicated ideas to be expressed in a clear and concise way. Because of this, code is not just easier to write, but easier to read and maintain as well.
