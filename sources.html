			<p>
				I found these references incredibly useful during my creation of this website and my progress in learning Swift. Although regarded as a poor source for information, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)"> Wikipedia </a> is generally good starting point, and is where I found out the basic information about Swift. 
				<br />
				<br />
				Next, I turned to the language's creator, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/"> Apple </a> and found there was more that enough information on this website. Apple is eager to showcase it's program in a detailed and thorough presentation, and I found the information there to be extremely helpful. It would be my go to source for this language. 
				<br />
				<br />
				Paired with that, we have <a href="https://swift.org"> Swift.org </a> , Swift's own website. This is had similar information to the Apple website, but it still presents it's information efficiently. 
				<br />
				<br />
				After looking at the offical sites, I found some information I found extremely useful on <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/"> Macworld </a>. They have more than enough articles on Swift, and every question I had was answered in the comments, or was covered in articles and other written pieces.
				<br />
				<br />
				And finally, I picked up <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/249"> "Programming Fundamentals with Swift" by Matt Neuburg </a> and <a href=" "> "Swift Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide" by Matthew Mathias and John Gallagher </a>. These, in my opinion, are the most helpful books on Swift currently. I enjoyed reading them, and the information in both books is cleverly given to the reading in a manner that is easy to understand. The information isn't overwhelming, and it's simple to follow, making these two books my favourite choices.
